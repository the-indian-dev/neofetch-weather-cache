Neofetch Weather Cache
----------------------
I wanted to cache my weather data so I don't have to send a new request everytime I open terminal. 

I implmented it by:
- Using systemd timer which curls the wttr.in api every hour
- Then the output is written to my file in my home directory
- print output ???

to install in ur system:
- modify city name from my Bhubaneswar to your city
- change user name to ur username
- install cache-weather.service and cache-weather.timer in systemd
